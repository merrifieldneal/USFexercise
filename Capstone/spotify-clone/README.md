# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Spotify: But better! = http://localhost:3000
Acts as a Spotify Clone, which allows you to type a song or artist name in the search bar and a list will populate the web page for you to select the song and play it. (needs premium spotify account to play music)
Search Bar, Login, Music UI, Volume Button - basic music playing stuff

To start project, you need to install node_modules in the following folders spotify-clone/src and spotify-clone/server with : npm i :

Run the following script on the server folder : npm run devStart : which is a nodemon script

Cd back to the src folder and run the following command : npm start

You should be greeted with a Login Screen. The search bar will now display related songs/artists below and if you have a premium account it WILL play the song as well.

Future Plans: Lyrics, Musics Videos?,

Tech Stack: React, React DOM, react-bootstrap Tabnine, nodemon, spotify web api node helper, express

I paid $10 to make sure it works on premium :)
