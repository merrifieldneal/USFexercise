Part 1
1. HTTP - Hyper text transfer protocol - its foundation of the www, 
an application layer protocol to send information between networked 
devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack
2.URL - uniform resource locater - the thing you enter into browser to go to specific website
has multiple segments to indicate hostname protocol resource and query
3. DNS - domain name system -  the thing thats always down when your internet doesnt work
servers that contain a key list pair of hostnames to ip addresses
4. Query string - part of the url that shows any requested querys, like filtering a shopping cart to show blue items
5. HTTP VERBS - Like different methods or request vs response? get vs post 
get is get data post is send some data
6. HTTP Request - request from client to server
7. HTTP Response - reponse from server to client
8. HTTP Header - header provides additional info about request or response
9. What happens when you enter a url 
Your browser “resolves” the name into an IP address using DNS
Your browser makes a request to that IP address, including headers (info about browser, any previous cookies, and other things)
The server sends a response (typically, HTML, with a status code (200 if it was sucessful)
The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc)
The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives response from the server for each
