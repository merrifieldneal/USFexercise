## 1.Two module exports in app.js?

2. Potential Bug: auth.js
   In the /login route, the User.authenticate method is called, but it seems to be missing the await keyword. Assuming that User.authenticate is an asynchronous function (since it's used with await in the /register route), you should add the await keyword when calling it in the /login route.

3. Potential Bug: users.js
   In the /delete route, the User.delete method is being called without await. Assuming that User.delete is an asynchronous function (since it is being used with await in other routes), you should add the await keyword when calling it in the /delete route. Otherwise, the response may be sent before the user is actually deleted.

4. Error Handling Improvement:
   Error Handling Improvement: In the /delete route, there is no error handling for the case when the user cannot be found. If the User.delete method throws an error when the user is not found, the route should respond with a 404 error.

5. Potential Issue: In the authUser middleware, the code decodes the JWT token using jwt.decode(token). The jwt.decode() function in the jsonwebtoken library only decodes the token and does not perform validation. It means that even if the token is expired or tampered with, the decoded payload will still be available. To ensure proper validation, use the jwt.verify() function instead of jwt.decode().

6. Issue:
   In the get method, if the user is not found in the database, the function doesn't actually return the ExpressError object, so the error won't be properly raised. Instead, it creates an ExpressError object but doesn't handle it properly. To fix this issue, make sure to return the ExpressError object when the user is not found.

7. Issue:
   The error message ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined typically occurs when running JavaScript code that relies on the TextEncoder or TextDecoder APIs in environments that do not support them. This error is commonly encountered in Node.js environments that use a version of Node.js that does not include these APIs by default (e.g., versions earlier than Node.js 11).
